# Installation
Froggi is on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/allliver/froggi/general)  
Alternatively, docker image archives can be found under [releases](https://github.com/AllLiver/Froggi/releases)  
  
If you would like to run Froggi as a standalone executable, then follow the guide on how to [compile](https://github.com/AllLiver/Froggi/edit/dev/README.md#compilation)

# Usage
On froggis first run, you will be prompted to create a login at localhost:3000 (unless the port is changed), and will be needed to login on every new device. 
Setting up match presets and sponsors is done through the "Sponsors & Teaminfo" tab in the burger menu  
Other settings can be found in the "Settings" tab in the burger menu  
Finally, there are some niche settings in "settings.json" located in the directory of Froggi's binary, these settings will only take effect upon a restart of Froggi  

# Compilation 
- Clone the main branch of Froggi by running
```
git clone https://github.com/allliver/froggi.git
```
- Install the [Rust Toolchain](https://rustup.rs/ "rustup") if you have not
